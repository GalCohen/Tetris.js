Tetris.js
======

An HTML5 tetris game I wrote to learn how to use  <canvas>

Controls
------------
spacebar - start or retstart the game.
p key - pause the game.
w or up arrow - rotate the tetris piece.
a or left arrow - move piece left.
d or right arrow - move piece right.
s or down arrow - move piece down.

Note:
------
This is a port of a game I wrote in Processing. I apologize if the code is a little funky in some places. It should work pretty well though... let me know if it doesn't.
Play it on my server and see how it compares to the Processing version [here](http://projects-galcohen.rhcloud.com/tetris/)
